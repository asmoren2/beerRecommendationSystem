# beerRecommendationSystem
Python and Django based beer recommendation system. 

Created using Python3 and Atom IDE :)

This web application serves as a base for a system that uses user inputed informations such as scores and reviews to recommend beers to a user.


Currently system as is uses SQLite as a database. I hope to port it to either PostgreSQL or MongoDB.


System takes the information given to it by the user to look for similar beers and finds the best fits to recommend.
